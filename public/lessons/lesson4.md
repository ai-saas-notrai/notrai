## Part B. Types of Notary Public Acts and How to Perform the Acts

Part B explains the most frequent and important acts in California law that a notary public may perform. Please note, a notary public only can use the notary public's seal for purposes described in the California Government Code and only can use the title "notary public" to render notarial services. (California Government Code section 8207.) A notary public must refuse to perform any notarial act that is not described in California law. For example, a notary public is prohibited from using the official seal and title "notary public" either on documents that are not described in California law or without the required notarial wording. (California Government Code sections 8202, 8205 and 8207; California Civil Code section 1189).) Doing either of these prohibited acts may cause the notary public's commission to be revoked or suspended or application denied.

Most notarial acts relate to another person signing or certifying a document. When a notary public performs an act in relation to a document, the document is commonly said to be "notarized." In fact, a notary public only notarizes the signature of the person who signed the document. However, a notary public cannot notarize his or her own signature or a transaction in which the notary public has a direct financial or beneficial interest. (California Government Code sections 8224 and 8224.1.)

### Section 1. Essential Basics

#### a. Examine Document

##### i. Incomplete Documents

A notary public cannot take an acknowledgment on a document that is incomplete.

(California Government Code section 8205.) When presented with a document containing a signature to be notarized, the notary public should visually scan the document to determine if the document is complete. Blank spaces and blank lines should be examined to ensure information is not missing. Also, if a notary public has experience with a particular type of document, and knows what information should be stated in the document, and that information is missing or incomplete, the notary public must refuse to notarize the signature. (California Government Code section 8205(a)(2).)

##### ii. Foreign Language Documents

A notary public can notarize a signature on a document written in a foreign language, whether or not they are familiar with the language, since a notary public's function only relates to the signature and not the contents of the document. However, a notary public must be able to communicate with the customer in order for the signer to swear or affirm the contents of an affidavit or to acknowledge the execution of a document, as well as to enable the notary public to obtain proper identification of the signer and to complete the required journal entries. An interpreter should not be used because vital information could be lost in the translation. If a notary public is unable to communicate with a customer, the customer should be referred to a notary public who speaks the customer's language. (See generally California Civil Code sections 1189 and 1195; California Government Code sections 8202, 8205 and 8206.)

The notary public should be able to identify the type of document for entry in the notary public's journal. If unable to identify the type of document, the notary public must make an entry to that effect in the journal, e.g., "a document in a foreign language." As in all cases, the notary public should determine if the document is complete and must not notarize the signature if the document appears to be incomplete. The notarial certificate in a foreign language document or attached to a foreign language document, e.g., the acknowledgment, jurat, or proof of execution by a subscribing witness must be written in English. California law requires these forms to be followed exactly and they appear in California law in the English language.

(California Civil Code sections 1188, 1189 and 1195; California Government Code section 8202.)

Please note also, special rules apply to advertising notarial services in a language other than English. These rules will be discussed later.

#### b. Verify Identity of the Signer

Before performing most notarial acts, the notary public must confirm the identity of the person signing the document. For acknowledgments and jurats, a notary public is required to obtain satisfactory evidence of the signer's identity. (California Civil Code sections 1185(a) and (b), and 1189; California Government Code section 8202.)

##### i. Satisfactory Evidence

Satisfactory evidence is the absence of any information, evidence, or other circumstances which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the individual is not the individual he or she claims to be and (A) identification documents meeting certain requirements or (B) the oath of a single credible witness or (C) the oaths of two credible witnesses. (California Civil Code section 1185(b).) Since January 1, 2008, a notary public's personal knowledge of a signer is not sufficient to establish the identity of the signer.

##### ii. Identification Documents

The identity of the signer can be established by the notary public's reasonable reliance on the presentation of identification documents meeting the requirements of California Civil Code section 1185(b)(3) or (b)(4). In addition, there must be no information or circumstances leading a notary public to believe a signer is not who the signer claims to be.

The types of identification documents listed below may be presented to a notary public to establish identity. These identification documents must be current, or have been issued within the previous five years. (California Civil Code section 1185(b)(3).)

- An identification card or driver's license issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles; or

- A A United States passport; or

- An inmate identification card issued by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, if the inmate is in custody in California state prison; or

- Any form of inmate identification issued by a sheriff's department, if the inmate is in custody in a local detention facility.

Other California approved identification cards, consisting of any one of the following, that contain a serial or other identifying number, a photograph of the named person, a description of the named person, and the signature of the named person are also acceptable. These forms of identification must also be current, or have been issued within the previous five years.

- A valid consular identification document issued by a consulate from the applicant's country of citizenship, or a valid passport from the applicant's country of citizenship;

- A driver's license issued by another state or by a Canadian or Mexican public agency authorized to issue drivers' licenses;

- An identification card issued by another state (this does not include an identification card issued by a Canadian or Mexican public agency);

- An identification card issued by any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States (military identification cards must still contain all of the information required by California Civil Code section 1185(b)(4) or they cannot be used as identification); or

- An employee identification card issued by an agency or office of a California city, a California county, a California city and county, or the State of California;

- An identification card issued by a federally recognized tribal government.

##### iii. Oath or Affirmation of a Single Credible Witness

If there is no information or circumstances leading a notary public to believe a signer is not who the signer claims to be, and it would be very difficult or impossible for the signer to present a paper identification document, the identity of the signer can be established by the oath of a single credible witness who personally knows the signer. However, the notary public also must personally know the credible witness and the credible witness must present a proper identification document. (California Civil Code section 1185(b)(1).)

"Personally known" is not defined currently in California law. But it is interpreted for notarial purposes in California to have the same meaning as defined in former California Civil Code section 1185(b), (see Volume 8, West's California Annotated Civil Code section 1185(b), (2007 edition), page 63), which is having an acquaintance with a person that establishes the person's identity with at least reasonable certainty. An acquaintance substantial enough to establish personal knowledge includes multiple, recent meetings with a person, including meetings during which the person is identified by other people. A chain of circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe an acquaintance is who they say they are forms the basis for personal knowledge. For example, co-workers have personal knowledge of each other if they meet frequently at their workplace and colleagues and customers have identified them in the presence of others. A person will not likely personally know a social acquaintance that the person sees infrequently. (See cases collected in West's California Annotated Civil Code (2007 edition) following section 1185.)

Even though the notary public will personally know the credible witness, the notary public must still confirm the credible witness' identity by examining a paper identification document that meets the requirements of California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4).

After the notary public has established the identity of the credible witness, the notary public must administer an oath or affirmation to the credible witness to establish the identity of
the signer. Under oath or affirmation, the credible witness must swear or affirm that each of the following statements is true (California Civil Code section 1185(b)(1)(A)(i)-(v)):

- The individual appearing before the notary public as the signer of the document is the person named in the document;

- The credible witness personally knows the signer;

- The credible witness reasonably believes that the circumstances of the signer are such that it would be very difficult or impossible for the signer to obtain another form of identification;

- The signer does not possess any of the identification documents authorized by law to establish the signer's identity; and

- The credible witness does not have a financial interest in the document and is not named in the document.

##### iv. Oath or Affirmation of Two Credible Witnesses

If there is no information leading a notary public to believe a signer is not who the signer claims to be, and it would be very difficult or impossible for the signer to present a paper identification document discussed earlier, the identity of the signer can be established by the oaths or affirmations of two credible witnesses who personally know the signer. (California Civil Code section 1185(b)(2).) In such a case, the notary public does not need to personally know either of the credible witnesses. The notary public establishes the identities of the two credible witnesses only by the presentation of the paper identification documents meeting the requirements of California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4).

After the notary public has established the identity of the credible witnesses, the notary public must administer oaths or affirmations to the credible witnesses to establish the identity of the signer. Under oath or affirmation and under penalty of perjury, both credible witnesses must swear or affirm that each of the following statements is true (California Civil Code section 1185(b)(2)):

- The individual appearing before the notary public as the signer of the document is the person named in the document;

- The credible witness personally knows the signer;

- The credible witness reasonably believes that the circumstances of the signer are such that it would be very difficult or impossible for the signer to obtain another form of identification;

- The signer does not possess any of the identification documents authorized by law to establish the signer's identity; and

- The credible witness does not have a financial interest in the document and is not named in the document.

### EXAMPLES

- Bob, Fred, and Joyce meet in a hotel lobby for the first time and after discussing the need to have their signatures on important documents notarized, approach Nat Notary. Bob is the signer of the documents and does not have his wallet with him because it was stolen. Fred and Joyce offer to vouch for Bob. Nat Notary refuses to use Fred and Joyce as credible witnesses since Bob, Fred and Joyce have just met and do not personally know each other. Fred and Joyce cannot be credible witnesses to Bob's identity.
- Nat Notary is called to notarize Irene's signature on a company document. Nat Notary and Irene have never met before. Irene is away from home and left her identification, her Illinois driver's license, in Chicago. Irene asks Rene to vouch for Irene because Irene and Rene have known each other for years. Nat Notary has also worked with Rene before. Rene can appear as a credible witness for Irene so that Nat Notary can complete the notarization.

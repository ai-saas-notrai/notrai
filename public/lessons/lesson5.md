#### c. Recording Journal Entry

All official acts performed as a notary public must be recorded sequentially in the notary public's active journal at the time the notarial act is performed. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(1).) A notary public is guilty of a misdemeanor if the notary public willfully fails to properly maintain his or her notarial journal. (California Government Code sections 8206(a) and 8228.1.)

The following discussion describes and explains the information that must be recorded in the journal.

- The date and time the notary public performed the notarial service. The time may be written in standard or military format, but the law requires the time of the act to be recorded - the date alone is insufficient. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(A).)

- The type of notarial act performed. For example, a proof of execution by a subscribing witness, an acknowledgment, and a jurat are all types of notarial acts. Any member of the public may request a photostatic copy of the journal entry representing a specific transaction, and copies of specific journal entries may be requested by the California Secretary of State, through civil and criminal subpoenas, or by a peace officer investigating a crime. Consequently, each journal entry should be full and complete. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(A).)

__Best practices tip__: A notary public should not write an abbreviation or acronym to describe the type of act. This may avoid confusion or misunderstandings as to the contents of the journal entry and type of notarial act.

- The character of every instrument sworn, affirmed, acknowledged, or proved before the notary public. The "character of every instrument" means the kind or type of document on which the signature is being notarized. Most notarial acts relate to another person signing or certifying a document. A description of the document containing the notarial act must be recorded in the journal in addition to the type of act performed. For example, most signatures on grant deeds are acknowledged. The journal entry for a grant deed will describe the character of the instrument as a "grant deed" and type of notarial act performed as an "acknowledgment." If more than one document contains notarized signatures, the notary public must record the title or character of each document. A separate line must be used for each document. For example, if a notary public completes an acknowledgment certificate on a deed of trust and an acknowledgment certificate on a promissory note, the notary public must record on separate lines in the journal that a
"deed of trust" and "promissory note" were the character of the instruments with notarized signatures, completing each line of the journal, in full. The notary public cannot simply state that "loan docs" or "closing documents" were acknowledged. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(B).)

- The signature of each person whose signature is being notarized. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(C).)

- A statement as to whether the identity of the person making an acknowledgment or taking an oath or affirmation was based on satisfactory evidence. A notary public must always obtain satisfactory evidence to prove the identity of a person making an acknowledgment or taking an oath or affirmation. The journal entry for all acknowledgments, jurats and proofs of execution must include a statement indicating satisfactory evidence was obtained. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(D).)

- If the notary public accepted an identification document as listed in California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4) to meet the requirements of "satisfactory evidence," then the notary public must record the type of identification document, the governmental agency that issued the identification, the serial or identifying number on the identification document, and the date the identification document was issued or expires.

- If the "satisfactory evidence" is based on the oath or affirmation of a single credible witness, then the journal must contain the signature of the credible witness or the type of identification document presented by the credible witness, the governmental agency that issued the identification, the serial or identifying number on the identification document, and the date the identification document was issued or expires. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(D).) Best practices tip: Obtain both the signature of the single credible witness and record the identifying document in the journal.

- If the "satisfactory evidence" is based on the oath or affirmation of two credible witnesses, then the journal must contain the signatures of each of the credible witnesses and the type of identifying documents presented by each of the credible witnesses, the governmental agency that issued each identification document, the serial number or other number on each identification document, and the date of issue or expiration of each identification document. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(E).)

- The fee charged for the notarial act. If no fee is charged, " 0 " should be indicated. Only fees for the notarial act should be listed in the "fee" column of the journal. If there are additional charges for travel or other services, those additional charges may be itemized in the "additional information" or "comments" column to distinguish those types of fees from notarial act fees. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(F).)

- If the document with the notarized signature is a deed, quitclaim deed, deed of trust, or other document affecting real property, or a power of attorney, the notary public must require the party signing the document to place his or her right thumbprint in the journal as part of the line item entry for the transaction. If the right thumbprint is not available, then the notary public must have the party use his or her left thumbprint, or any available finger and must record the left thumbprint or which other fingerprint is captured in the journal. If the party signing the document is physically unable to provide a thumbprint or fingerprint, the notary public must record that fact in the journal and must provide an explanation of the physical condition of the person. The thumbprint is not required for trustee's deeds for a decree of foreclosure or a nonjudicial foreclosure, or a deed of reconveyance. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(G).)

### Section 2. Acknowledgments

The most frequently performed notarial act is an acknowledgment. An acknowledgment is the notarial certificate attached to a document when the notary public confirms the identity of the signer and the signer acknowledges being the signer of the document. The certificate of acknowledgment is identified by the wording "whose name is subscribed to the within instrument and acknowledged to me that he executed the same. ..." A certificate of acknowledgment often will be found at the end of a document.

By completing a certificate of acknowledgment, the notary public is certifying under penalty of perjury:

- That the signer personally appeared before the notary public on the date indicated and in the county indicated in the venue heading;

- To the identity of the signer (based on satisfactory evidence); and

- That the signer acknowledged signing the document. (California Civil Code section 1189.)

To perform an acknowledgment, a notary public must:

- Examine the document for completeness;

- Confirm the identity of the signer (based on satisfactory evidence) and the signer's acknowledgment of the signature;

- Complete a journal entry for the transaction; and

- Attach a completed certificate of acknowledgment to the document or complete the certificate of acknowledgment at the end of the document. (California Civil Code section 1188.)

By completing a certificate of acknowledgment, the notary public is not certifying the legality of the underlying document.

#### a. Examine for Completeness

A notary public cannot take an acknowledgment of an instrument (document) that is incomplete. The notary public should visually scan the document and if the document appears to be incomplete, the notary public must refuse to take the acknowledgment until the document is completed. However, in determining whether the document is complete, the notary public should ignore information that is intended to be added later such as information to be placed on the document by a county clerk or recorder or for additional signers whose signatures are not being notarized by the notary public. (California Government Code section 8205(a)(2).)

#### b. Confirm Identity of Signer and Acknowledgment of Signature

A notary public must confirm that the person signing the document and acknowledging the signature is the person described in the document as the signer. A notary public must confirm the identity of the signer by obtaining satisfactory evidence. The signer's identity may
be established by the oaths or affirmations of one or two credible witnesses, or the signer may present the required identification document.

With respect to taking an acknowledgment and completing the certificate of acknowledgment, the signer does not need to sign the document in front of the notary public, but the signer must personally appear before the notary public and acknowledge to the notary public that he or she signed the document. (California Civil Code section 1189.)

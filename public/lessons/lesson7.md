#### e. Penalties

A notary public who completes a certificate of acknowledgment that contains statements the notary public knows to be false may be liable for civil penalties and administrative action.

(California Government Code section 8214.15.) Additionally, the notary public will be guilty of forgery if he or she issues an acknowledgment knowing it to be false. (California Penal Code section 470(d).) A person who falsifies the acknowledgment of a notary public may also be guilty of forgery. (California Penal Code section 470(d).) Forgery is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year. (California Penal Code section 473.) False certification by a notary public also may be a misdemeanor. (California Government Code section 6203.)

Additional penalties for failing to enter required information in the journal or falsely modifying journal entries are discussed later in this course.

### EXAMPLE

On January 5, 2016, Abe Signer signs a document for his corporation at Abe's corporate office in San Joaquin County. On that same day, Abe then takes the document to Nancy Notary to have Abe's signature notarized. Nancy first must establish Abe's identity. Nancy establishes Abe's identity by checking Abe's driver's license issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. In front of Nancy, Abe acknowledges that it is Abe's signature on the document. Nancy then needs to fill out the journal. Nancy's journal must include the date, time and type of act. Nancy needs to have Abe sign the journal. Nancy also needs to make an affirmative statement in the journal that Abe's identity was based on satisfactory evidence and that the evidence Abe presented Nancy with was Abe's driver's license, issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Abe's driver's license number and the date of issue or expiration of the driver's license. Nancy enters the fee charged for the notarial act. Last, Nancy fills out the certificate of acknowledgment (as shown below). Nancy enters the name of the county where Nancy and Abe are physically located, the date of the notarial act (January 5, 2016), Nancy's name and title, and Abe's name as it appears on Abe's identification. Nancy then signs the certificate, stamps it with Nancy's seal and attaches the certificate of acknowledgment to the document.

### Section 3. Jurats

The second most frequently performed notarial act is administering an oath or affirmation and completing a jurat. A jurat is the notarial certificate attached to a document when a person signs a document and swears under oath or affirms that the contents of the document are true and correct. The notarial certificate for a jurat is identified by the wording "Subscribed and sworn to (or affirmed)." The jurat also typically will be found at the end of the document.

A document containing statements sworn or affirmed by the signer to be true and correct typically is referred to as an "affidavit" or a "declaration," and the signer will be said to be "subscribing and swearing (or affirming) to" the contents of the affidavit. A jurat must be attached to, or located at the end of, all affidavits subscribed and sworn (or affirmed) before the notary public. (California Government Code section 8202.) A notary public cannot attach or complete a jurat if the signer of a document does not swear or affirm to the truth of the contents of the document.

By completing a jurat, the notary public certifies:

- That the signer personally appeared before the notary public on the date indicated and in the county indicated;

- To the identity of the signer by satisfactory evidence;

- That the notary public administered the oath or affirmation; and

- That the signer signed the document in the presence of the notary public. (California Government Code section 8202.)

To perform an oath or affirmation and jurat, a notary public must:

- Confirm the identity (by satisfactory evidence) of the person signing and swearing (or affirming) to the affidavit;

- Administer an oath or affirmation;

- Watch the signer sign the affidavit;

- Complete a journal entry for the transaction; and

- Complete and attach a jurat to the affidavit or complete the jurat at the end of the affidavit. (California Government Code sections 8202 and 8206(a).)

#### a. Examine for Completeness

A document executed with a jurat should not be signed before the document is presented to the notary public because the signer must sign the document in the presence of the notary public. (California Government Code section 8202(a).) Also, the date of signature for the signer of the document should not conflict with the actual date the signer appears before the notary public to obtain the jurat. Best practices tip: Visually scan the document for completeness. Make sure there are no blank lines or spaces for data to be entered at some later time.

#### b. Confirm Identity

A notary public must confirm that the person signing and swearing to an affidavit is the person described as the signer in the document. A notary public must confirm the identity of the signer of the affidavit by obtaining satisfactory evidence. In fact, a notary public must confirm the identity of the signer of the affidavit in the same way they confirm the identity of a person obtaining an acknowledgment. The signer's identity may be established by the oaths or affirmations of one or two credible witnesses, or the signer may present one of the identification documents as stated in California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4).

#### c. Administer Oath or Affirmation and Witness Signature

A notary public must always administer an oath or affirmation before completing a jurat. (California Government Code section 8202(a).) Generally, the notary public obtains the oath or an affirmation under penalty of perjury from the witness that the matters stated in the document are true. (California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2093 and 2094; California Evidence Code section 165.)

Although there is no prescribed wording for the oath or affirmation to be administered by a notary public outside of a civil or criminal proceeding, an acceptable oath or affirmation would be:

"Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the contents of this document are the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God;” or

"Do you solemnly swear or affirm, under penalty of perjury, that the contents of this document are the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?” (California Code of Civil Procedure section 2094(a); California Evidence Code section 165.)

After the signer swears or affirms to the truth of the contents of the document, the notary public must watch the signer sign the document. (California Government Code section
8202(a).) A notary public cannot complete or affix a jurat to a document mailed or otherwise delivered to a notary public for which the signer did not personally appear, take the oath or affirmation, and sign in the presence of the notary public in any circumstances, even if the notary public knows the signer.

#### d. Journal Entry

A notary public must record the following details in their sequential journal about every oath or affirmation administered and jurat given. (California Government Code section 8206(a).)

Time and date of the act.

A An indication that the type of notarial act performed was a jurat. The notary public simply can write the word "jurat."

- Type of document subscribed and sworn or affirmed. The type of document usually will be stated in the title of the document. If the document does not have a title, the notary public may indicate the type of document is a "declaration" or "affidavit."

- Signature of the signer.

- An indication the notary public obtained satisfactory evidence of the signer's identity. The notary public's sequential journal must contain a statement that the identity of a person taking an oath or affirmation for a jurat was based on satisfactory evidence.

- Details of how the identity of the signer was established.

  - If the identity was established by examination of an identification document described in California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4), the notary public must record the type of identification document, the governmental agency that issued the identification document, the serial or identifying number on the identification document, and the date the identification document was issued or expires.
  - If the identity was established by the oath or affirmation of one credible witness, then the notary public must record the name of the credible witness and the credible witness must sign the notary public's journal, or the notary public must record the type of identification document presented by the credible witness, the governmental agency that issued the identification document, the serial or identifying number on the identification document, and the date the identification document was issued or expires. Best practices tip: The notary public should obtain the signature of the single credible witness and record the information for the identification document of the single credible witness to ensure complete information is available for a public request, a California Secretary of State inquiry, a civil or criminal subpoena, or a peace officer investigating a crime.
  - If the identity of the signer was established by the oaths of two credible witnesses, then both credible witnesses must sign the notary public's journal. The notary public must record the name of each credible witness, the type of identification document presented by each witness, the governmental agency that issued each
identification document, the serial or identifying number on each identification document, and the date each identification document was issued or expires.

- Fee charged for the notarial act.

- Right thumbprint of the signer, if the type of document is a deed, quitclaim deed, deed of trust, or other document affecting real property (other than trustee's deeds resulting from a decree of foreclosure or a nonjudicial foreclosure or a deed of reconveyance), or a power of attorney.

The following is an example of a completed journal entry for a jurat.

#### e. $\quad$ Notarial Certificate for a Jurat

A completed jurat must be attached to the affidavit or the notary public must complete the jurat included with the affidavit. The jurat must be filled out completely at the time the notary public signs the jurat and affixes the seal. (California Government Code section 8202(b).) Jurats must be in the following statutory form. If the language differs on a document with a preprinted notarial certificate for a jurat, it cannot be used and a separate jurat complying with the statutory language must be attached to the document. (California Government Code
section 8202(b).) A notary public seal and signature cannot be affixed to a jurat without the correct notarial wording.

The following specific disclaimer must appear at the top of the jurat: "A notary public or other officer completing this certificate verifies only the identity of the individual who signed the document to which this certificate is attached, and not the truthfulness, accuracy, or validity of that document." It must be in an enclosed box, appear at the top of the certificate and be legible, i.e. in a font or typeface that is readable and does not impair its readability. (California

The first part of the jurat certificate indicating in what county the notary public and person taking the oath (or affirming) are located is the "venue" statement. The venue statement establishes where the notary public administered the oath or affirmation and where the signer personally appeared before the notary public. The "State" is always California, since the notary public has jurisdiction only within California. The "County" should be completed with the county where the oath or affirmation was administered and jurat completed, that is, where the signer personally appeared before the notary public, took an oath or affirmation, and signed the document. Since a notary public can provide services anywhere within California, the "County" in the venue statement may not necessarily be the county where the notary public maintains his or her principal place of business, or the county where his or her oath and bond are filed, but must be completed with the name of the county in which the notarial act took place.

The notary public must complete the jurat with the day, month and year that the signer personally appeared before the notary public, took the oath or affirmation and signed the document, and the notary public must enter the name of the person signing and swearing to the truth of the document where indicated after the word "by," then the notary public must sign and stamp the jurat with their notarial seal.

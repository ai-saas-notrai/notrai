#### f. Jurats for Documents with Birthdates and Age

A notary public cannot certify copies of vital records, such as birth, marriage or death certificates. However, a notary public can administer an oath or affirmation and give a jurat for
an affidavit that states the birthdate or age of the affiant, and/or includes a photograph of the affiant and/or fingerprints or thumbprints of the affiant. In effect, a signer can certify their own vital information by swearing to the contents of a document containing that information.

If the notary public gives a jurat for a document that includes the signer's birthdate or age and a photograph or their finger or thumb print, the notary public must require the signer to verify their birthdate or age by showing a certified copy of the signer's birth certificate or an identification card or driver's license issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. (California Government Code section 8230.)

#### EXAMPLE

Paul Jones and his children formed a small family company to distribute the products they made at home. On July 1, 2016, Paul wanted to get a bank loan, so he went to Nancy Notary who was located in Monterey County. Paul brought a copy of a family document that showed Paul's age and a thumbprint. This document would be part of Paul's loan application. Nancy administered the oath or affirmation to Paul and examined a photocopy of Paul's birth certificate. Nancy could not complete the jurat, though, until Paul returned on August 3, 2016 with a certified copy of the birth certificate. Nancy re-administered the oath or affirmation and completed the jurat. Nancy also entered Paul's information in her sequential journal, including the fact that Paul presented Nancy with a certified copy of Paul's birth certificate for review.

### Section 4. Proof of Execution by a Subscribing Witness

If a person, (the "principal"), has signed a document but cannot personally appear before a notary public, another person, (the "subscribing witness"), can appear on the principal's behalf to prove the principal signed (or "executed") the document. (California Code of Civil Procedure section 1935.) This method of proving the person who signed a document is the person described as the signer in it is called a "proof of execution by a subscribing witness," or simply "proof of execution." A proof of execution proves the identity of the principal, i.e., the person who has signed a document. A principal cannot swear to the truth of the contents of a
document by means of a proof of execution. A proof of execution by a subscribing witness cannot be used in conjunction with any power of attorney, quitclaim deed, grant deed (other than a trustee's deed or deed of reconveyance), mortgage, deed of trust, security agreement, or any instrument affecting real property. Also, a proof of execution by a subscribing witness cannot be used on any document requiring a notary public to obtain a thumbprint from the party signing the document in the notary public’s journal. (California Government Code section 27287;



By completing a proof of execution, the notary public certifies:

- The subscribing witness personally appeared before the notary public on the date indicated and in the county indicated;

- The identity of the subscribing witness was established by the oath or affirmation of a credible witness whom the notary public personally knows and who personally knows the subscribing witness;

- The credible witness presented an identification document satisfying the requirements described in California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4); and

- The subscribing witness proved the identity of the principal by stating, under oath or affirmation, (1) the person who signed the document as a party, the principal, is the person described in the document, (2) the subscribing witness personally knows the principal, (3) the subscribing witness saw the principal sign the document or in the presence of the principal heard the principal acknowledge that the principal signed the document and, (4) the subscribing witness was requested by the principal to sign the document as a witness and that the subscribing witness did so. (California Civil Code section 1195(c).)

To perform a proof of execution, a notary public must:

- Examine the document for completeness;

- Confirm the identity of the credible witness, who the notary public personally knows, by examining an identification document described in California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4);
- Administer an oath or affirmation to the credible witness swearing to the identity of the subscribing witness;

- Administer an oath or affirmation to the subscribing witness swearing to the identity of the principal;

- Complete a journal entry for the transaction; and

- Attach a completed proof of execution certificate to the document. (California Civil Code section 1195; California Government Code section 8206(a).)


#### a. Examine for Completeness

A notary public cannot take a proof of execution of a document that is incomplete.

(California Government Code section 8205(a)(2).) The notary public should visually scan the document and if it appears to be incomplete, the notary public must refuse to perform the notarial service until the document is completed. However, in determining whether the document is complete, the notary public should ignore information that is intended to be added later such as
information to be placed on the document by a county clerk or recorder or for additional signers whose signatures are not being notarized by the notary public.

#### b. Confirm the Identity of the Credible Witness

A notary public must personally know the credible witness who is proving the identity of a subscribing witness. Also, the credible witness must personally know the subscribing witness who is proving the identity of a principal signer to a document.

As described earlier, "personally known" in California is interpreted to mean having an acquaintance with a person that establishes the person's identity with at least reasonable certainty. (See Volume 8, West's California Annotated Civil Code section 1185(b), (2007 edition), page 63.) An acquaintance substantial enough to establish personal knowledge includes multiple, recent meetings with a person, including meetings during which the person is identified by other people. A chain of circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe an acquaintance is who they say they are forms the basis for personal knowledge. For example, coworkers have personal knowledge of each other if they meet frequently at their workplace and colleagues and customers have identified them in the presence of others. A person will not likely personally know a social acquaintance whom the person sees infrequently. (See cases collected in West's California Annotated Civil Code (2007 edition) following section 1185.)

Even though the notary public will personally know the credible witness, the notary public must still confirm the identity of the credible witness by examining an identification document described in California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4).

#### c. Administer the Oaths or Affirmations

After the notary public has established the identity of the credible witness, the notary public must administer an oath or affirmation to the credible witness for the credible witness to establish the identity of the subscribing witness. Under oath or affirmation the credible witness must swear or affirm that each of the following statements is true (California Civil Code section 1185(b)(1)(A)(i)-(v).):

- The individual appearing before the notary public claiming to have subscribed their name to a document as a subscribing witness is the person named as subscribing witness in the document;

- The credible witness personally knows the subscribing witness; and

- The credible witness does not have a financial interest in the document and is not named in the document.

After the credible witness has sworn or affirmed to the identity of the subscribing witness, the subscribing witness must prove the identity of the document signer. To prove the identity of the document signer or principal, the notary public must administer an oath or affirmation to the subscribing witness. The subscribing witness must swear or affirm that each of the following statements is true:

- The person who signed the document as a party, the principal, is the person described in the document;

- The subscribing witness personally knows the principal (California Civil Code section 1197);

- The subscribing witness saw the principal sign the document or in the presence of the principal heard the principal acknowledge that the principal signed the document (California Code of Civil Procedure 1935; California Civil Code section 1197); and

- The subscribing witness was requested by the principal to sign the document as a witness and that the subscribing witness did so. (California Code of Civil Procedure 1935; California Civil Code section 1197.)

#### d. Journal Entry

A notary public must record in their sequential journal the following details about every proof of execution by subscribing witness. (California Government Code section 8206(a).)

- Time and date of the act.

- Type of notarial act performed. The type of act would be a "proof of execution by a subscribing witness.”

- Type of document. The type of document usually will be stated in the title of the document. If the document does not have a title, ask the subscribing witness to describe the purpose of the document and record the subscribing witness' description in the journal.

- __Best practices tip__: The name of the principal should be included.

- Signature of the subscribing witness. (__Best practices tip__: The name of the subscribing witness should be included, but only the signature is required.)

- Name, signature and identification of credible witness. The notary public must obtain the signature of the credible witness or must record the type of identification document presented by the credible witness, the governmental agency that issued the identification document, the serial or identifying number on the identification document, and the date the identification document was issued or expires. (Best practices tip: The name, signature and identification of the credible witness should be included.)

- Fee charged for the notarial act.

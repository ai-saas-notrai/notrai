#### e. Proof of Execution Certificate

Any certificate for a proof of execution by a subscribing witness taken in California must be in the following form. Other formats with similar wording no longer are acceptable.


The following specific disclaimer must appear at the top of the proof of execution: "A notary public or other officer completing this certificate verifies only the identity of the individual who signed the document to which this certificate is attached, and not the truthfulness, accuracy, or validity of that document." It must be in an enclosed box, appear at the top of the certificate and be legible, i.e. in a font or typeface that is readable and does not impair its readability. (California Civil Code section 1195.)

The first part of the certificate, indicating in what county the notary public, subscribing witness and the credible witness appeared before the notary public is the "venue" statement. The venue statement establishes where the notary public performed the proof of execution, which is where the subscribing and credible witnesses appeared before the notary public. The "State" is always California for notaries public, since California notaries public have jurisdiction only within California. The "County" is the county where the proof of execution was performed, that is where the subscribing and credible witnesses personally appeared before the notary public, swore an oath or affirmed, and provided proof of execution. Since a notary public may provide services anywhere within California, the "County" in the venue statement may not necessarily be the county where the notary public maintains his or her principal place of business, or the county where his or her oath and bond are filed, but must be completed with the name of the county in which the notarial act took place.

The day, month and year must be completed with the date the subscribing and credible witnesses personally appeared before the notary public. Next to or in place of "name and title of officer" write the name of the notary public and "notary public." The name of the subscribing witness must be completed where indicated after the words "personally appeared" and also where indicated in the first blank line of the second paragraph. The name of the credible witness must be inserted where indicated after the words "on the oath of." The name of the principal, the person signing the document who has not appeared before the notary public but told the subscribing witness that he or she signed the document, must be inserted where indicated after
the words "saw/heard" and also where indicated after the words "at the request of." Then the notary public must sign and stamp the certificate with their notarial seal.

#### EXAMPLE

The principal, Paul, wants to have his signature on a document notarized. Paul is in the hospital and cannot appear before a notary public. So Paul asks a long time friend, Sue, to visit the hospital and act as a subscribing witness. When Sue comes to the hospital, Sue must watch Paul sign the document. If Paul has signed the document prior to Sue's arrival, Paul must say (acknowledge) to Sue that Paul signed the document. Then Paul should ask Sue to sign the document as a subscribing witness, and Sue must do so.

Next, Sue must take the document to a notary public. Sue chooses Nancy Notary as the notary public. Sue must bring a credible witness with her to see Nancy Notary, the notary public. Sue chooses Carl, a long time friend, as a credible witness because Carl has worked with Nancy Notary for several years. Therefore, Carl can act as Sue's credible witness.

Sue and Carl appear together before Nancy. Nancy determines Nancy personally knows Carl and also examines Carl's California Drivers License to establish Carl's identity. Then Nancy puts Carl under oath. Under oath or affirmation, Carl swears or affirms that Carl personally knows Sue, that Sue is the person who signed the document as a subscribing witness, and Carl does not have a financial interest in the document signed by Paul and subscribed by Sue, and is not named in the document signed by Paul and subscribed by Sue. Then Nancy puts Sue under oath. Under oath, Sue swears or affirms Sue personally knows Paul, that Paul is the person described as a party in the document, that Sue watched Paul sign the document or heard Paul acknowledge that Paul signed the document, that Paul requested Sue sign the document as subscribing witness and that Sue did so.

Sue signs Nancy's notary public journal as a subscribing witness. Carl must sign Nancy's notary public journal as a credible witness, or Nancy must record in the journal that Carl presented a California Department of Motor Vehicles driver's license, the license number, and the date the license expires.

Nancy completes Nancy's notary public journal entry. Nancy then completes a proof of execution certificate and attaches the proof of execution certificate to the document. Sue takes the notarized document back to Paul.

### Section 5. Signature by Mark

A person who cannot write his or her name still can acknowledge his or her signature on a document, or subscribe and swear to an affidavit, by making a mark. (California Civil Code section 14.) To perform a notarization with a signature by mark, the notary public still performs the steps required for the appropriate notarial act, such as an acknowledgment or jurat. The notary public must use the appropriate form as well. The notary public must confirm the identity of the person making the mark, by satisfactory evidence. (California Civil Code section 1185.) The notary public also must perform the following additional steps:

- If the signer must acknowledge his or her signature on a document, the signer can make a mark where his or her signature should be in the presence of the notary public or can acknowledge that the mark in the place for a signature is his or her mark. Note that the "mark" does not need to be an "X."

- If the signer is subscribing and swearing to an affidavit, the signer must make a mark where his or her signature should be in the presence of the notary public. Note that the "mark" does not need to be an "X."

- Two witnesses must observe the signer making their mark and must sign their names next to the signer's mark on the document. One of the witnesses must write the name of the signer making the mark next to the signer's mark.

- The signer also must make his or her mark as the required signature in the notary public's journal. The making of the mark in the notary public's journal must be witnessed by a person. The witness must sign his or her name next to the mark and write the name of the signer next to the mark. The notary public can serve as the witness for the signer's journal signature.

The witnesses only are verifying that they witnessed the individual make his or her mark. A notary public is not required to identify the two persons who witnessed the signing by mark or to have the two witnesses sign the notary public's journal. Exception: If the witnesses were acting in the capacity of credible witnesses in establishing the identity of the person signing by mark, then the witnesses' signatures must be entered in the notary public public's journal.

Following are examples of a jurat and journal entry for a signature by mark.

### Section 6. Certifying Copies

A notary public can certify the copies of only a few types of documents. The notary public only can certify copies of:

- Powers of attorney (California Probate Code section 4307; California Government Code section 8205(a)(4)); and

- Copies of his or her sequential journal, or portions of the journal, in response to a written request of the California Secretary of State or a subpoena or court order. (California Government Code sections 8205(b)(1) and 8206(e).)

Certified copies of birth, fetal, death, and marriage records can be made only by the State Registrar, by a duly appointed and acting local registrar during their term of office, and a county recorder.

To certify a copy of a power of attorney, a notary public must:

- Compare the original power of attorney document and the copy to make sure the copy is exactly true and correct, or make a copy of the original of the original power of attorney document;

- Attach a notarial certificate to the copy, stating that the copy is a true and correct copy; and

- Complete a journal entry.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/snip/images/ivTVWpqxWiLYQKEAAu92CdTk3PyFVCgZdvkAtzDDu5Y.original.fullsize.png)

The first part of the certificate indicating in what county the notary public and person requesting the certified copy are located is the "venue" statement. The venue statement establishes where the notary public performed the certification and where the person requesting the copy appeared before the notary public. The "State" is always California, since the notary public has jurisdiction only within California. The "County" is the county where the certification was performed, that is where the person requesting the certified copy personally appeared before the notary public and presented the original power of attorney for a certified copy. Since a notary public may provide services anywhere within California, the "County" in the venue statement may not necessarily be the county where the notary public maintains his or her principal place of business, or the county where his or her oath and bond are filed, but must be completed with the actual county in which the notarial act took place.

The notary public must insert his or her name and the day, month and year the person requesting the certified copy personally appeared before the notary public and the notary public compared and certified the copy of the power of attorney. Then the notary public must sign and stamp the certificate with their notarial seal.

#### b. Journal Entry

A notary public must record the following details in their sequential journal each time the notary public certifies a copy of a power of attorney. (California Government Code section 8206(a).) Best practices tip: To ensure completeness for a later request for information related to this type of transaction, the notary public should also record the name of the person who is requesting the certified copy, the name of the agent appointed by the power of attorney and the person who signed the power of attorney (the principal).

- Time and date of the act.

- The type of notarial act performed was certifying a copy of a power of attorney.

- The fee charged for the notarial act.

### Section 7. Immigration Documents

A notary public can notarize the signature on a document affecting the immigration or citizenship status of any person. (California Government Code sections 8205 and 8223.) The notary public cannot assist a person in completing any immigration document, except for the signature and date. Only an attorney, a representative accredited by the U.S. Department of Justice, or a person who is registered by the California Secretary of State and bonded as an immigration consultant under the California Business and Professions Code may assist a client in completing immigration forms. (California Business and Professions Code section 22440.) Only an attorney can advise a person regarding which immigration document or form the person should complete, or advise how the person should answer questions posed by an immigration document or form.

If a notary public is also a California registered immigration consultant, that notary public may assist a client by inserting the answers given to the consultant by a client. (California Business and Professions Code section 22441(a)(1); California Government Code section 8223.) A notary public who is also a registered and bonded immigration consultant may charge \$15 per person for completing a set of immigration forms. A notary public also can charge an additional fee for each notarial act performed in relation to a set of immigration forms.


Please note that special rules apply to notaries public who are also immigration consultants, or advertise their services in a language other than English. A notary public is barred from advertising in any manner whatsoever that he or she is a notary public if the notary public also promotes himself or herself as an immigration specialist or consultant. (California Government Code section 8223.)

A notary public who is not a licensed California attorney and advertises notarial services in a language other than English must post with the advertisement both in English and the other language, that the notary public is not an attorney and cannot give legal advice about immigration or any other legal matters. The notary public also must list the statutory fees that a notary public may charge for notarial services. (California Government Code section 8219.5.) In many countries outside the United States, an individual must be a duly licensed attorney before he or she may obtain a notary public commission. In Latin American countries, the phrase "notario publico" implies that the person is a practicing attorney in that country, which is not the law in the State of California. Under California law, a person may be appointed and commissioned as a notary public without being a licensed attorney. Therefore, a notary public
cannot translate the term "notary public," as "notario publico" or "notario," into Spanish, even if the prescribed notice is posted. (California Government Code section 8219.5.) A first offense for a violation of this law is grounds for the suspension of the notary public's commission for not less than one year, or revocation of a notary public's commission. A second offense is grounds for the permanent revocation of a notary public's commission. (California Government Code section 8219.5.)

#### EXAMPLE

Catherine Consultant is a notary public and has been registered and bonded as a California immigration consultant. Mikhail and Irina visit Catherine to obtain assistance in completing citizenship forms. Catherine's business cards say she is a notary public and an immigration specialist. Catherine enters information into the citizenship forms that Mikhail and Irina provide and enters information she knows from her own experience and education as an immigration consultant. For these combined services Catherine charges Mikhail and Irina \$100.

Catherine has broken a number of laws. She cannot hold herself out as a notary public in her advertising because she is an immigration specialist. Catherine cannot enter information into immigration forms on her own and Catherine cannot charge more than \$15 per person for completing the forms on behalf of her clients. Catherine can charge an additional notary fee for any notarial services, if she limits herself to completing the citizenship forms with only information provided by Mikhail and Irina, but can charge no more than the statutory $\$ 15$ for each signature notarized. The permitted statutory fees are less than the total Catherine charged Mikhail and Irina.

### Section 8. Protests

The duty of a notary public on demand to protest the nonacceptance and nonpayment of foreign or inland bills of exchange, or promissory notes is a nearly obsolete mechanism developed before modern regulation of financial transactions. Only those notaries public employed by a financial institution and in the course and scope of that employment are permitted to perform protests with regard to the specific financial documents described by California law. Because only notaries public employed by a financial institution can perform a protest in the course and scope of their employment, no fee is prescribed for the notarial service since it is part of the notary public's service to the financial institution. (California Government Code sections 8205 and 8208; California Commercial Code section 3505.)

### Section 9. Depositions

When requested, it is a duty of a notary public to take depositions. However, a notary public cannot record and transcribe an oral deposition in shorthand unless the notary public is also a certified shorthand reporter and licensed by the Court Reporters Board of California. A notary public may take an oral deposition by writing it out in longhand or typing it out longhand on an electronic device. This may be awkward and cause confusion or misunderstanding. If a notary public is asked to take a deposition and the notary public is not a certified shorthand reporter, the notary public should inform the person asking the notary public to take the deposition that the notary public can take the deposition by hand in longhand or by typing the deposition in longhand, or the person may wish to contact a certified shorthand reporter to take the deposition.

Generally, a deposition is a method of providing oral or written testimony under oath outside of a court proceeding. (California Civil Code section 14; California Code of Civil Procedure sections 17, 2025.010 et seq., and 2028.010 et seq.) During an oral deposition, a witness, who has been put under oath, answers questions from a judge, attorney, or other officer of a court. In a civil proceeding, a deposition officer, who also is a certified shorthand reporter, can put a witness under oath, and record the oral deposition in shorthand for transcribing the shorthand record into a standard English language verbatim written transcript of the questions, answers and other statements made during the deposition. (California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.330.) Consequently, although it is a duty of a notary public to take depositions, a notary public is not necessary when a deposition is conducted.

### Section 10. Confidential Marriages

A notary public who is interested in obtaining authorization to issue confidential marriage licenses may apply to the county clerk for approval in the county in which the notary public resides. A notary public must not issue a confidential marriage license unless he or she is approved by the county clerk having jurisdiction. The county clerk offers a course of instruction, which a notary public must complete before authorization will be granted. Additionally, in order for a notary public to perform the marriage, he/she must be one of the persons authorized under California law, e.g., priest, minister, or rabbi. (California Family Code sections 400 - 402.) The county clerk in the county where the notary public resides may or may not approve the authorization to issue confidential marriage licenses. The county clerk should be consulted if the notary public is interested in obtaining approval. (California Family Code section 530 et seq.)

## Part C. Fees

There are four basic rules about the fees a notary public can charge.

First, there are maximum fees allowed by law that a notary public can charge. A notary public cannot charge more than those maximum fees. (California Government Code section 8211.)

Second, except for notaries public employed for and on behalf of a state or county public agency, a notary public is not required to charge a fee at all. A notary public could decide, for example, not to charge a fee for completing a certificate of acknowledgment or providing a photostatic copy of his or her journal pages. Also, a notary public's employer could make it a condition of employment that the notary public charges no fee for notarial services.

Third, whether or not a notary public charges a fee, the notary public must record the actual amount charged in the notary public's sequential journal, including writing zero to indicate no fee was charged. In other words, a number or zero must be reflected in the notary public's journal to complete the record for each notarial act. (California Government Code section 8206(a).)

Fourth, no fee is prescribed for notaries public employed by a financial institution who can perform a protest in the course and scope of their employment since it is part of the notary public's service to the financial institution. (California Government Code sections 8205(a)(1), 8208 and 8211; California Commercial Code section 3505.)

### Section 1. Maximum Fees Allowed

The maximum fees a notary public may charge are:

- For an acknowledgment or proof of a deed, or other instrument, including the seal and writing the certificate, $\$ 15$ for each signature acknowledged.

- For administering an oath or affirmation to one person and executing the jurat, including the seal, $\$ 15$.

- For all services in connection with the taking of any deposition, $\$ 30$, and an additional $\$ 7$ for administering the oath to the witness and $\$ 7$ for the certificate to the deposition.

- For certifying a copy of a power of attorney under California Probate Code section 4307, \$15.

- $\$30$ per line item copied from the notary public's journal.

### Section 2. Required Fees

If a notary public is appointed to act for and on behalf of a state or county public agency as an employee of the agency, fees must be charged for all services and those fees must be remitted or turned over to the employing agency. (California Government Code sections 6100 and 8202.5.) The actual fee charged must be entered in the notary public's sequential journal. (California Government Code section 8206(a).)

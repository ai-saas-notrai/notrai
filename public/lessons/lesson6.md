#### c. Journal Entry

A notary public must record the following details in their sequential journal about every acknowledgment performed. (California Government Code section 8206.)

- Time and date of the act.

- Indicate that the type of notarial act performed was an acknowledgment. Best practices tip: The notary public should write out the word "acknowledgment," rather than use any type of abbreviation.

- Type of document. The type of document usually will be stated in the title of the document. If the document does not have a title, ask the signer to describe the purpose of the document and record the signer's description in the journal.

- Signature of the person signing the document.

- Indicate that satisfactory evidence of the signer's identity was obtained. The notary public's sequential journal must contain a statement that the identity of a person making an acknowledgment was based on satisfactory evidence. (California Civil Code section 1185.)

- Details of how the identity of the signer was established.

  - If the identity was established by examination of an identification document described in California Civil Code sections 1185(b)(3) and (b)(4), the notary public must record the type of identification document, the governmental agency that issued the identification document, the serial or identifying number on the identification document, and the date the identification document was issued or expires.
  - If the identity was established by the oath or affirmation of one credible witness, then the notary public must record the name of the credible witness and the credible witness must sign the notary public's journal or, the notary public must record the type of identification document presented by the credible witness, the governmental agency that issued the identification document, the serial or identifying number on the identification document, and the date the identification document was issued or expires. (California Government Code section 8206(a)(2)(D)). As noted previously, best practice would be to obtain the signature of the single credible witness and record the information for the identification document of the single credible witness to ensure complete information is available for a public request, a California Secretary of State inquiry, a civil or criminal subpoena, or a peace officer investigating a crime.
  - If the identity was established by the oaths or affirmations of two credible witnesses, then both credible witnesses must sign the notary public's journal. The notary public must record the name of each credible witness, the type of identification document presented by each witness, the governmental agency that issued each identification document, the serial or identifying number on each identification document, and the date each identification document was issued or expires. (California Government Code sections 8206(a)(2)(D) and (E).)

- Fee charged for the notarial act.

- Right thumbprint of the signer, if the type of document is a deed, quitclaim deed, deed of trust, or other document affecting real property (other than trustee's deeds resulting from a decree of foreclosure or a nonjudicial foreclosure or a deed of reconveyance), or a power of attorney.

##### i. Sample Journal Entries

The California Secretary of State does not endorse or recommend any particular commercially printed notarial journal. Any journal that includes space for recording all the required details is acceptable. Many commercially printed notarial journals have space for recording other information not required by California law, such as the date of the document, the address of the signer and transaction notes.

Most notarial journals provide for recording the details of a transaction across two pages; the record begins on the left and is completed on the facing page. Each page has corresponding numbered lines and the transaction details to be recorded on line 1 of the left page for instance, correspond with transaction details to be recorded on line 1 of the facing page. The following example demonstrates recording the details of a transaction across two pages.

Note: Effective January 1, 2017, fees which may be charged for certain notarial acts have increased.

#### d. Certificate of Acknowledgment

A certificate of acknowledgment must be completed at the time the notary public's signature and seal are affixed to the document. The certificate of acknowledgment cannot be added to or altered after the notary public's seal and signature are affixed to the document. (California Civil Code sections 1188 and 1193.) Under no circumstances can the signature and seal be affixed in advance of the notarization of a signature. (California Government Code section 8214.1(j).) Since January 1, 2006, the California certificate of acknowledgment has been required to be exactly in the form in California Civil Code section 1189, rather than "substantially" in the form in the statute. (California Civil Code section 1189.) Also, the certificate of acknowledgment must be executed under penalty of perjury. (California Civil Code section 1189.)

The following specific disclaimer must appear at the top of the certificate of acknowledgment: "A notary public or other officer completing this certificate verifies only the identity of the individual who signed the document to which this certificate is attached, and not the truthfulness, accuracy, or validity of that document." It must be in an enclosed box, appear at the top of the certificate and be legible, i.e. in a font or typeface that is readable and does not impair its readability. (California Civil Code section 1189.)

Since variations in the California form are not permitted, a notary public must ensure that if a document contains a suggested "certificate of acknowledgment," the certificate must have the statutory wording required by California Civil Code section 1189. If not, then a separate certificate of acknowledgment with the correct exact statutory wording must be used and attached to the document. (California Civil Code sections 1188 and 1189.)

A notary public may complete an out-of-state acknowledgment form that will be used in another state or territory of the United States as long as the notary public does not determine or certify that the signer holds a particular representative capacity or make other determinations and certifications not allowed by California law. (California Civil Code section 1189(c).) For example, a notary public could not complete an out-of-state acknowledgment form on a document to be recorded out-of-state if it requires the California notary public to certify the signer is president of a particular corporation. In such a case, the California all-purpose acknowledgment form must be used instead of the out-of-state acknowledgment form. In addition, the California all-purpose acknowledgment form must be used for any document that will be used in another country.

Any certificate of acknowledgment taken within this state must be in the following form: (California Civil Code section 1189.)

A notary public seal and signature cannot be affixed to a certificate of acknowledgment without the correct notarial wording.

The first part of the certificate of acknowledgment indicating in what county the notary public and person making the acknowledgment are located is the "venue" statement. The venue statement establishes where the notary public performed the acknowledgment and where the signer personally appeared before the notary public. The "State" is always California, since the notary public has jurisdiction only within California. The "County" should be completed with the name of the county where the signer personally appeared before the notary public and acknowledged the signing of the document. Since a notary public can provide services anywhere within California, the "County" in the venue statement may not necessarily be the county where the notary public maintains his or her principal place of business, or the county where his or her oath and bond are filed, but must be completed with the name of the county where the notarial act took place.

The day, month and year must be completed with the date the signer personally appeared before the notary public and acknowledged signing the document. The notary public must insert his or her name and title "notary public" where indicated, and the name of the person who acknowledges their signature on the document after "personally appeared." Then the notary

public must sign and stamp the certificate with the notarial seal. (California Civil Code section 1193.)

#### e. Penalties

A notary public who completes a certificate of acknowledgment that contains statements the notary public knows to be false may be liable for civil penalties and administrative action.

(California Government Code section 8214.15.) Additionally, the notary public will be guilty of forgery if he or she issues an acknowledgment knowing it to be false. (California Penal Code section 470(d).) A person who falsifies the acknowledgment of a notary public may also be guilty of forgery. (California Penal Code section 470(d).) Forgery is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year. (California Penal Code section 473.) False certification by a notary public also may be a misdemeanor. (California Government Code section 6203.)

Additional penalties for failing to enter required information in the journal or falsely modifying journal entries are discussed later in this course.

### EXAMPLE

On January 5, 2016, Abe Signer signs a document for his corporation at Abe's corporate office in San Joaquin County. On that same day, Abe then takes the document to Nancy Notary to have Abe's signature notarized. Nancy first must establish Abe's identity. Nancy establishes Abe's identity by checking Abe's driver's license issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. In front of Nancy, Abe acknowledges that it is Abe's signature on the document. Nancy then needs to fill out the journal. Nancy's journal must include the date, time and type of act. Nancy needs to have Abe sign the journal. Nancy also needs to make an affirmative statement in the journal that Abe's identity was based on satisfactory evidence and that the evidence Abe presented Nancy with was Abe's driver's license, issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Abe's driver's license number and the date of issue or expiration of the driver's license. Nancy enters the fee charged for the notarial act. Last, Nancy fills out the certificate of acknowledgment (as shown below). Nancy enters the name of the county where Nancy and Abe are physically located, the date of the notarial act (January 5, 2016), Nancy's name and title, and Abe's name as it appears on Abe's identification. Nancy then signs the certificate, stamps it with Nancy's seal and attaches the certificate of acknowledgment to the document.

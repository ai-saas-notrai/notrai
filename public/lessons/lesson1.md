# Chapter I. Obtaining and Managing a Commission

## Part A. Eligibility for Appointment

The California Secretary of State appoints notaries public in California. (California Government Code section 8200.) The California Secretary of State may appoint as many notaries public as necessary for the public convenience. (California Government Code section 8200.)

To be eligible for appointment, a person must:

+ Be a California resident at the time of appointment (unless appointed to serve on a military or naval reservation);

+ B Be at least 18 years of age;

+ Complete a course of study approved by the California Secretary of State;

+ Pass a written, proctored, closed-book examination; and

+ Pass a background check.

(California Government Code sections 8201, 8201.1 and 8203.1.)

### Section 1. Residence/Citizenship Requirement

Except for notaries public appointed to serve on military and naval reservations, a notary public appointed in California must be a resident of California at the time of appointment. (California Government Code sections 8201(a)(1) and 8203.1.) Similarly, a notary public does not need to be a United States citizen; however, California law requires that a notary public appointed to serve on a military or naval reservation must be a United States citizen. (California Government Code section 8203.1.)

### Section 2. Age Requirement

All applicants for appointment must be at least 18 years of age. (California Government Code sections 8201(a)(2) and 8203.1.)

### Section 3. Course of Study Requirement

An applicant for a notary public commission must satisfactorily complete a six-hour course of study that is approved by the California Secretary of State concerning the functions and duties of a notary public. (California Government Code section 8201(a)(3).) Also, an applicant for a notary public commission who (1) holds an active notary public commission and (2) has satisfactorily completed a six-hour notary public education course approved by the California Secretary of State must satisfactorily complete a three-hour refresher course approved by the California Secretary of State prior to reappointment as a notary public. (California Government Code section 8201(b)(2).)

An individual whose commission expires before applying for a new commission must take an approved six-hour notary public education course before they can be appointed for another term as a notary public, even if the individual previously satisfactorily completed an approved six-hour course. (California Government Code section 8201(b)(2).) Notaries public who have satisfactorily completed another six-hour course within two years of applying for
reappointment as a notary public have satisfied the three-hour refresher course requirement. (California Government Code section 8201(a)(3) and (b)(1).)

### Section 4. Examination Requirement

All applicants for appointment must pass a written, proctored, closed-book examination prescribed by the California Secretary of State. (California Government Code section 8201(a)(4).)

### Section 5. Background Check Requirement

All applicants must complete a background check by submitting fingerprints to the California Department of Justice within one year of satisfactorily completing the examination. (California Government Code section 8201.1(a).) The Department of Justice will compare the applicant's fingerprints and identity information with California conviction records. The Department of Justice will forward the applicant's fingerprints and other identifying information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and both the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation will advise the California Secretary of State whether the applicant has a criminal history record anywhere in the United States. An applicant convicted of a disqualifying crime may be denied appointment. (California Government Code section 8214.1(b).) A disqualifying crime is any felony, or a lesser offense involving moral turpitude or of a nature incompatible with the duties of a notary public. (California Government Code section 8214.1(b).) For more information about disqualifying crimes, please review the current Notary Public Disciplinary Guidelines, available on the California Secretary of State's website at www.sos.ca.gov/notary. (California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 20804.)

### Section 6. Application

All applicants for appointment must complete the Notary Public Application form prescribed by the California Secretary of State each time they apply for a commission, whether they currently hold a commission as a notary public, a previous commission has expired or they are applying for the first time.

A Notary Public Application form and information regarding the appointment process can be found on the California Secretary of State's website at www.sos.ca.gov/notary.

The California Secretary of State must determine that an applicant possesses the required honesty, credibility, truthfulness and integrity to fulfill the responsibilities of the office of notary public. (California Government Code section 8201.1(a).) An applicant must disclose any arrest for which trial is pending and any conviction, whether or not the conviction may be a disqualifying conviction, and regardless of where and when the conviction occurred, including any convictions dismissed under California Penal Code sections 1203.4 or 1203.4a. Convictions and arrests for which a trial is pending must be disclosed on every application submitted to the California Secretary of State, even those convictions that were disclosed on a previous application, and including convictions dismissed under California Penal Code sections 1203.4 or 1203.4a. Failure to disclose any conviction or arrest for which a trial is pending may be a substantial and material misstatement or omission on the application and grounds for denial of an application for appointment. (California Government Code section 8214.1(a).)

Other grounds for denying an application for appointment are detailed later in this course. The key point to remember is that the application for appointment as a notary public must be complete without any omission or misstatement of required information.

## Part B. Commission

### Section 1. Term of Office

The term of office for a notary public is four years starting with the commencement date stated in the commission issued by the California Secretary of State. (California Government Code section 8204.) This is true whether an appointment is for the first time or whether the person has been issued a previous commission. The critical starting date is the commencement date stated in the commission, rather than the date the commission was issued or mailed by the California Secretary of State or the date the commission was received by the person in the mail.

However, a person cannot serve as a notary public until both their oath of office and bond have been filed with the county clerk, and both must be filed within 30 days of the commencement date of the four-year term stated in the commission. (California Government Code section 8213.) A notary public commission issued by the California Secretary of State does not take effect unless the oath of office and bond are filed on time with the county clerk. If the 30-day deadline is missed, the commission is invalid.

### Section 2. Geographic Jurisdiction

A notary public's jurisdiction is not limited to the county in which the notary public's oath and bond are filed, but a California notary public cannot perform notarial acts outside of the borders of California. (California Government Code section 8200.) Additionally, a notary public appointed to serve on a military or naval reservation is authorized to act only within the boundaries of the reservation for which he or she is appointed.

### EXAMPLE

Maria Mobile's principal place of business is in Truckee, California.

Accordingly, Maria filed her oath and bond at the Nevada County Clerk's office

in Nevada County, California. Maria often travels to South Lake Tahoe, in El Dorado County, to perform notarial acts for residents there. Patrick Pressure asks Maria to come to his home in Stateline, Nevada, to perform an acknowledgment on a document to be filed in El Dorado County. Maria must refuse to perform the acknowledgment in the State of Nevada. As an alternative, Maria may request that Patrick meet her in South Lake Tahoe, (El Dorado County), California or any other convenient location in California to perform the acknowledgment.

### Section 3. Bond

A notary public must obtain a bond from a California admitted surety insurer in the amount of $\$ 15,000$. The bond must be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the notary public's principal place of business is located. (California Government Code section 8212.) The bond is to provide a limited fund to reimburse members of the public who are damaged by notarial misconduct. However, the notary public and the surety named on the notary public's official bond are liable in a civil action for all the damages sustained from a notary public's misconduct or neglect. (California Government Code section 8214.)

__Best practices tip__: There may be personal liability for the notary public to the surety for the amount paid on the bond as damages and if the damages exceed the amount of the bond. Therefore, a notary public should consider purchasing errors and omissions insurance, or some other type of liability insurance, to cover damages that may occur in the course of performing their notarial duties. A negligent notary public may still be personally liable for damages, costs and attorney's fees exceeding insurance policy limits and for damages not covered by insurance.

### Section 4. Public Employee Notaries Public

The California Secretary of State may appoint an employee of a California state, city or county public agency, or public school district to serve as a notary public for and on behalf of that public entity. These notary public employees only may perform notarial acts for and on behalf of their public entity employer. These notary public employees are not authorized to perform notarial acts on their own time. These notary public employees must maintain personal control of their journal. The public entity employer may pay the costs of the notary public's bond and supplies and any fees collected by the notary public employee must be remitted or turned over to their public entity employer. (California Government Code section 8202.5.) If the notary public is terminated or resigns, the termination or resignation is treated as a resignation of the notary public's commission as well. On termination or resignation from employment with the public entity: (1) the employee must immediately send written notice of resignation to the California Secretary of State; (2) all notarial records must be delivered to the county clerk within 30 days; and (3) the notary public's seal must be defaced or destroyed. (California Government Code section 8209.)

The California Secretary of State may appoint federal civil service employees to serve as notaries public for military and naval reservations within the State of California. (California Government Code sections 8203.1 and 8203.3.) A notary public appointed to serve on a military or naval reservation must be a U.S. citizen, but does not have to be a California resident. (California Government Code section 8203.1.) These notaries public may perform notarial acts only on the reservation for which they were appointed and they cannot collect fees for any service. (California Government Code sections $\mathbf{8 2 0 3 . 2}$ and 8203.6.) These notary public federal civil service employees must maintain personal control of their journal. If the notary public stops being a federal civil service employee, the commanding officer of the military or naval reservation must notify the California Secretary of State of the termination, and the termination is treated as a resignation of the notary public's commission. (California Government Code section 8203.4.) Again, upon termination or resignation from employment with the military or naval reservation, all notarial records must be delivered to the county clerk within 30 days and the notary public's seal must be defaced or destroyed. (California Government Code section 8209.)

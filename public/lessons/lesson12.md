### Section 3. When Fees Cannot Be Charged

There are very specific times when a notary public is prohibited from charging a fee:

- Notaries public appointed to military or naval reservations cannot charge a fee for any notarial service or act. (California Government Code section 8203.6.)

- A notary public acting in his or her official capacity on behalf of the State, city, or county or any public body cannot charge for notarization of an affidavit, application, or voucher in relation to securing a pension. (California Government Code section 6106.)

- A notary public cannot charge for notarization of a signature on an application by a United States military veteran for a claim for a pension, allotment, allowance, compensation, insurance or any other veteran's benefit. (California Government Code sections 6107 and $8211(i)$.
- A notary public cannot charge to notarize signatures on vote by mail ballot identification envelopes or other voting materials. (California Government Code section 8211(g).)

- A notary public cannot charge for notarizing any nomination document or circulator's affidavit. (California Elections Code section 8080.)

# Chapter III. Misconduct by Notaries Public or Others Relating to Notarial Acts

Misconduct by notaries public or others in connection with notarial acts may be addressed through criminal, civil or administrative laws and proceedings.

Criminal misconduct may be a felony, misdemeanor or infraction. A felony is punishable by a term in state prison or county jail. A fine may also be imposed in addition to any imprisonment. A misdemeanor is punishable by a term in jail, probation, a fine or all three. An infraction is punishable by a fine. Criminal misconduct may result in the revocation, suspension or denial of a notary public's commission or application.

Civil misconduct subjects a notary public to fines and may also lead to suspension or revocation of the notary public's commission or denial of a notary public application by the California Secretary of State. (California Government Code section 8214.1(e).) Also, a notary public and the sureties on the notary public's official bond are liable in a civil action for all the damages sustained from a notary public's misconduct. (California Government Code section 8214.)

Administrative action can be taken against a notary public or notary public applicant to suspend or revoke a notary public commission or deny a notary public application for failing to discharge the duties and responsibilities required of a notary public. (California Government Code section 8214.1(d).)

## Part A. Conflict of Interest

A notary public who has a direct financial or beneficial interest in a transaction cannot perform any notarial act in connection with that transaction. (California Government Code

section 8224.) Best practices tip: Since California is a community property state, it is important for a notary public to exercise great care when performing notarial services for a spouse or domestic partner in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest.

### Section 1. Financial Transactions

If a notary public is named individually as a principal in a financial transaction, the notary public has a direct financial or beneficial interest in the transaction and a conflict of interest and cannot perform any notarial acts in connection with that transaction. (California Government Code section 8224.) For example, if the notary public is named as a party in a contract or is assigned the proceeds of a sale, the notary public has a direct financial conflict of interest and must not perform any notarial acts in connection with the transaction.

### Section 2. Real Property

In the area of real property, a notary public has a conflict of interest if the notary public is a grantor, grantee, mortgagor, mortgagee, trustor, trustee, beneficiary, vendor, vendee, lessor, or lessee in the transaction. (California Government Code section 8224.) For example, if a notary public is a grantee of a deed of sale for a house or is assigned rents or is paying off a home mortgage, the notary public is prohibited from performing any notarial act in connection with that transaction.

### Section 3. No Conflict of Interest if Acting for Someone Else

If a notary public acts as an agent, employee, insurer, attorney (assuming the notary public is admitted to practice law in California), escrow or lender for another person who has a direct financial or beneficial interest in a transaction, then the notary public does not have a prohibited direct financial or beneficial interest. (California Government Code section 8224(b).) In other words, a notary public acting as an agent for another person can perform notarial services. Or if a notary public works for a company that will receive benefits or money from a transaction, the notary public can perform notarial services in connection with that transaction. The notary public is not benefiting directly, even if the notary public's employer receives a benefit.

## Part B. Giving Legal Advice/Practicing Law

A notary public is prohibited from practicing law, unless the notary public is also a licensed California attorney. (California Government Code section 8214.1(g); California Business and Professions Code section 6215.) Since a notary public comes into contact with a large number of legal documents, from deeds to wills to contracts, among many others, there may be a temptation to offer advice or comment on legal aspects of the documents instead of carrying out the notarial activities alone. But it is very important to remember that a notary public cannot undertake any acts that constitute the practice of the law. Among the acts that constitute the practice of law are the preparation, drafting, or selection of legal documents, or giving advice with relation to any legal document or legal matter. For example, if a customer brings a document to a notary public without a notarial certificate and asks the notary public to "notarize" it, the notary public cannot provide advice or decide for the customer whether a certificate of acknowledgment should be completed or whether a jurat would be in order. The customer must decide.

Best practices tip: If the customer is unsure, the notary public should recommend that the customer confer with the party receiving the document or that the customer consult with an attorney.

## Part C. Reasons for Commission Revocation or Suspension, or Application Denial

Notary public applicants must disclose on their application all arrests for which trials are pending and all convictions. (California Government Code section 8201.1 and 8201.5.) The California Secretary of State can deny an application for failing to disclose any convictions, either felonies or misdemeanors, including convictions dismissed under California Penal Code sections 1203.4 or 1203.4a. (California Government Code section 8214.1(a).)

If the California Secretary of State either denies an application or proceeds to revoke or suspend the commission of a notary public, the person affected has a right to a hearing on the matter. (California Government Code section 8214.3.) However, there are two exceptions. The first exception occurs when the California Secretary of State already has denied an application or revoked or suspended a commission in a proceeding within the previous year. (California Government Code section 8214.3(a).) The second exception is if a notary public's commission has already expired, and after a proceeding in which the person had an opportunity for a hearing, the California Secretary of State makes an order that there were or were not grounds for revoking or suspending the notary public's commission for misconduct. (California Government Code section 8214.3(b).)

Even if a notary public's commission has expired or the notary public has resigned, if the notary public has committed acts that could be grounds for suspension or revocation of the commission, the California Secretary of State can still go ahead with an investigation or disciplinary action following the expiration or resignation of a commission. (California Government Code section 8214.4.)

The reasons the California Secretary of State may refuse to appoint someone to act as a notary public or revoke or suspend a notary public's commission are found in California Government Code section 8214.1. They are:

- Substantial and material misstatement or omission in the application submitted to the California Secretary of State to become a notary public.

- Conviction of a felony, a lesser offense involving moral turpitude, or a lesser offense of a nature incompatible with the duties of a notary public. A conviction after a plea of nolo contendere is deemed to be a conviction.

- Revocation, suspension, restriction, or denial of a professional license, if the revocation, suspension, restriction, or denial was for misconduct based on dishonesty, or for any cause substantially relating to the duties or responsibilities of a notary public.

- Failure to discharge fully and faithfully any of the duties or responsibilities required of a notary public.

- When adjudicated liable for damages in any suit grounded in fraud, misrepresentation or for a violation of the state regulatory laws, or in any suit based upon a failure to discharge fully and faithfully the duties as a notary public.

- The use of false or misleading advertising wherein the notary public has represented that the notary public has duties, rights, or privileges that he or she does not possess by law.

- The practice of law in violation of California Business and Professions Code section 6125.

- Charging more than the allowable maximum statutory fees.

- Commission of any act involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit with the intent to substantially benefit the notary public or another, or substantially injure another.

- Failure to complete the acknowledgment at the time the notary public's signature and seal are affixed to the document.

- Failure to administer the oath or affirmation as required by California Government Code section 8205(a)(3).

- Execution of any certificate as a notary public containing a statement known to the notary public to be false.

- Violation of California Government Code section 8223. This section of the California Government Code primarily makes it illegal for someone holding himself or herself out as an immigration specialist or immigration consultant to advertise in any way that he or she is a notary public.

- Failure to submit any remittance payable upon demand by the California Secretary of State or failure to satisfy any court-ordered money judgment, including restitution.

- Failure to secure the sequential journal of official acts, pursuant to California Government Code section 8206, or the official seal, pursuant to California Government Code section 8207, or willful failure to report the theft or loss of the sequential journal, pursuant to California Government Code section 8206(b).

- Translating "notary public" into Spanish or advertising in a language other than English in violation of California Government Code section 8219.5.

- Commission of an act in violation of California Government Code sections 6203 (delivery of a certificate known to be false), $\mathbf{8 2 1 4 . 2}$ (willful fraud in connection with a deed of trust), $\mathbf{8 2 2 5}$ (soliciting as notary public to perform a known improper notarial act), or $\mathbf{8 2 2 7 . 3}$ (non-notary placing encumbrance on real property single family residence); or of California Penal Code sections 115 (knowingly filing false or forged document placing an encumbrance on single family residence), $\mathbf{4 7 0}$ (forgery), $\mathbf{4 8 7}$ (grand theft), 487a(a) (grand theft of specified animals, or the carcass or portion of a carcass of any such animal), or $\mathbf{5 3 0 . 5}$ (willfully obtaining personal information of another for criminal purposes).

- Willful failure to provide access to the sequential journal of official notarial acts upon request by a peace officer.
